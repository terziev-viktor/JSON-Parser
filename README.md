# JSON-Parser
This is my 1st course project in FMI.

1. Reading from a file  
   The program reads a json from a .txt or .json file. Creates a list of all json object in the file  
2. Validation  
   The program validates the input and gives feedback on any error. What exactly is the error and where did it occur. 
3. Edit  
   The json object can edit every sub-object in it  
4. Add  
   The object can add more sub-objects in  
5. Remove  
   The object can remove sub-objects  
   
Each object can be compared to other objects. Objects can also modified, indexed swapped, printed...  

## The OOP Design
The OOP Designs I'm using are Composite, Abstract Factory and something that looks like an Interpreter :D
