# JSON-Parser
This is my 1st course project in FMI.

Coming soon - the following functionality:
1. Validation  
   The program validates the input and gives feedback on any error. What exactly is the error and where did it occur.  
   
2. Reading from a file  
   The program reads a json from a .txt or .json file.

## The OOP Design
The OOP Design I'm using is Composite.
* The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
* Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
