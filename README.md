# JSON-Parser
This is my 1st course project in FMI.

1. Reading from a file  
   The program reads a json from a .txt or .json file. Creates a list of all json object in the file
   
Coming soon - the following functionality:
1. Validation  
   The program validates the input and gives feedback on any error. What exactly is the error and where did it occur.  
2. Edit
   The json object can edit every sub-object in it  
3. Add  
   The object can add more sub-objects in  
4. Remove  
   The object can remove sub-objects
